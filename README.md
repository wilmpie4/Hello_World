# Backgroud and Personal info

Dear reader,

My name is Willem van Veghel. I've studied at different Universities and therefore have a solid background in statistics as well as (bio)mechanical mathematics. Over Recent (working) years I've specialised myself in BI (Business Intelligence). Mainly working for Financial departments in the wider Healthcare sector. I do have a background in ETL especially in the microsoft stack using ssis, ssrs. I've use SQL for a multitude of years. On top of that in my latest job I've been using Python for financial analysis.

The goal of this project is to backup and show mainly python scripts but I will also save some slq once I've written some more of these scripts. Ofcourse there will be python connections to db's where I will also some sql will need to be integrated.

# Python
1 year experience (junior/medior level)

# SQL
6 years experience (medicor/senior level)

# VBA
Once every so often I needed to write macro's in excel (junior level)

the app in this repo functions as a BI tool. In which only changes in data will be saved but you can see your history because of the way the data is saved. Furthermore there are some statistical features which need to be further developed.
