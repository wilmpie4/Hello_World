Hi guys,

i've generated a pyqt app which grasps upon a ms sql table. It also contains possibilities to plot, update or delete the data. Furthermore
only changes are saved on the sql server.

I'm still working on statistical and ai possibilities such as sklearn. The app still needs a lot of tweeking :)
